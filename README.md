# Inveon React Crud Web App

This project was developed as part of  the Inveon Fullstack Bootcamp. It is designed to manage and display tutorials, each consisting of a title and a description. The project allows users to add new tutorials, list existing ones, and provides a basic string search filter for easy tutorial retrieval.

* React + Vite
* Bootstrap
* [Mockapi.io](https://www.mockapi.io) for Backend

I hosted the website by deploying it via [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com). You can review and test it by clicking the link below.
